In this update, I decided to redesign everything. The concept, the system, the forms, etc.
It's been so long since I commited the last changes to this project. Now, I'll be more hands on again.

I started working on the designing system. I also made a quick update on the open project page.
It's been hours now and I decided to make another major change, the project system.
I have to change it because of the concept changes. Let's see if I'll be able to do it.

Today, the project system is done. Well, almost done actually. The project loader is so simple for now.
I recommend you to change the project loader system if you want to edit the program and publish it.
You know, it should be at least encrypted for security stuffs.

Today, I changed the designer file extension. I'm actually going to redo the Editor.
I'm going to remove the custom function and custom variable because we're not using the Node-Editor system for now.

I also changed some variables name for more readable code, I guess.
